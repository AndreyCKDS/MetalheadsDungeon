# Metalheads Dungeon

## About project

<b>Metalheads Dungeon</b> is a rogue-like game which combines game mechanics of top-down-shooter, rogue-like game and rythm game with combo system.

## Features

### Inspiration
This game  is inspired by such games as Enter the Gungeon, The Binding of Isaac, Crypt of the NecroDancer, Guitar hero and Devil May Cry. I took the most exiting features of this games (as it seems to me) and implemented them in that project.

### Gameplay mechanics

- <b>Rogue-like</b>  
The system of a random dungeon generation was choosen in order to achieve a replayability. The game structure is made of few levels, each has specific enemies and a special environment. As progressing through the game the difficulty level increases as well as a player's equipment and his characteristics. In every run the player will have a random set of dropped items, that will create a unique experience.

- <b>Bullethell</b>  
The combat system and the design of enemies force a player to dodge a plenty of enemies' individually created missiles with a specific traectrory. The player's main goal is to defeat them by precise aiming and efficient using of his deadly arsenal wich consists of the multiple weapons, active skills and combos.

- <b>Rythmgame</b>  
One of the main features of the game is that all of the actions and activities that take place in the game are syncronized with the same tempo (like in Crypt of the NecroDancer). This allows a very cool sound design concept, according to which all sound effects of a player, enemies and NPCs generate general melody. This rythm game implementation also gives opportunity to make combo system, so that you need to press keys in specific order and timing to get a certain attack. 

### Design
The design of NPCs, enemies, items and environment is a combination of classic fantasy style and Rock culture. In the game you can find a lot of references to different bands and rock stars and their work. The soundtrack is also inspired by different styles of rock music.
